# Nodes and Edges

## Overview
Nodes and edges are the fundamental building blocks of graph databases. Nodes represent entities (people, products, concepts), while edges represent relationships between those entities. Understanding nodes and edges is essential for working with graph databases.

## Definition
In graph databases:
- **Nodes** (also called vertices) are entities in the graph, representing things like people, products, or concepts
- **Edges** (also called relationships) are connections between nodes, representing relationships like "friends with", "purchased", or "contains"

Together, nodes and edges form the graph structure that enables efficient relationship traversal.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Entities in the graph
- **Edges**: Relationships between nodes
- **Properties**: Attributes on nodes and edges
- **Direction**: Edges can be directed or undirected
- **Edge Types**: Different types of relationships
- **Node Types**: Different types of entities
- **Graph Structure**: Structure formed by nodes and edges

## How It Works

Graph structure:

1. **Node Creation**: Create nodes representing entities
2. **Node Properties**: Add properties to nodes
3. **Edge Creation**: Create edges between nodes
4. **Edge Properties**: Add properties to edges
5. **Edge Direction**: Define edge direction
6. **Edge Types**: Define relationship types
7. **Traversal**: Traverse graph via edges

Characteristics:
- **Direct Relationships**: Direct connections between entities
- **Rich Properties**: Properties on both nodes and edges
- **Flexible Structure**: Flexible graph structure
- **Efficient Traversal**: Fast relationship traversal

## Use Cases

- **Social Networks**: Modeling social connections
- **Recommendations**: Finding related items
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Representing knowledge
- **Fraud Detection**: Detecting relationships
- **Network Analysis**: Analyzing networks

## Considerations

- **Data Modeling**: Different modeling approach
- **Query Patterns**: Must match query patterns
- **Graph Size**: Very large graphs can be challenging
- **Traversal Depth**: Deep traversals can be expensive

## Best Practices

- **Design Nodes**: Design node structure
- **Design Edges**: Design edge types and properties
- **Use Properties**: Leverage properties effectively
- **Plan Traversals**: Plan traversal patterns
- **Index Appropriately**: Index node and edge properties
