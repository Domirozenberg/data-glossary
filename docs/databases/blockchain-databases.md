# Blockchain Databases

## Overview
Blockchain databases use blockchain technology to create immutable, distributed ledgers. They provide tamper-proof data storage with cryptographic verification, making them suitable for applications requiring audit trails, provenance, and trust without central authority.

## Definition
A blockchain database stores data in a blockchain structure - a distributed ledger of cryptographically linked blocks. Each block contains data and a hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain that is distributed across multiple nodes.

## Key Concepts

- **Immutable Ledger**: Immutable record of transactions
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Cryptographic verification
- **Distributed**: Distributed across nodes
- **Consensus**: Consensus mechanisms
- **Blocks**: Data organized in blocks
- **Chain**: Blocks linked in chain
- **Decentralized**: No central authority

## How It Works

Blockchain databases:

1. **Transaction Creation**: Create transactions
2. **Block Formation**: Group transactions into blocks
3. **Hashing**: Hash block with previous block hash
4. **Consensus**: Reach consensus on block validity
5. **Chain Addition**: Add block to chain
6. **Distribution**: Distribute chain across nodes
7. **Verification**: Verify chain integrity

Characteristics:
- **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed
- **Verification**: Cryptographic verification
- **Distribution**: Distributed across nodes
- **Consensus**: Consensus-based validation

## Use Cases

- **Audit Trails**: Immutable audit trails
- **Provenance**: Tracking data provenance
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contract execution
- **Supply Chain**: Supply chain tracking
- **Identity**: Decentralized identity
- **Financial**: Cryptocurrency and DeFi

## Considerations

- **Performance**: Lower performance than traditional databases
- **Storage**: Growing storage requirements
- **Energy**: Energy consumption (proof-of-work)
- **Complexity**: Operational complexity
- **Regulatory**: Regulatory considerations

## Best Practices

- **Assess Need**: Assess if blockchain needed
- **Choose Consensus**: Select consensus mechanism
- **Plan Storage**: Plan for growing storage
- **Consider Alternatives**: Consider alternatives
- **Understand Limitations**: Understand limitations
