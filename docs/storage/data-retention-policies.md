# Data Retention Policies

## Overview
Data retention policies define how long data should be kept before it is deleted or archived. They are essential for compliance, cost management, and data governance, ensuring data is retained for appropriate periods and disposed of when no longer needed.

## Definition
Data retention policies specify the duration for which different types of data should be retained, when data should be archived, and when data should be permanently deleted. They are based on business requirements, regulatory compliance, and legal obligations.

## Key Concepts

- **Retention Period**: How long data is kept
- **Data Classification**: Classifying data for different retention periods
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Compliance with regulations
- **Legal Requirements**: Legal data retention requirements
- **Automated Enforcement**: Automating policy enforcement
- **Data Disposal**: Secure data deletion
- **Policy Exceptions**: Handling exceptions to policies

## How It Works

Data retention policies:

1. **Policy Definition**: Define retention policies by data type
2. **Data Classification**: Classify data according to policies
3. **Retention Tracking**: Track data age and retention status
4. **Policy Evaluation**: Evaluate data against retention policies
5. **Action Execution**: Execute retention actions (archive, delete)
6. **Compliance Monitoring**: Monitor compliance with policies
7. **Audit Trail**: Maintain audit trail of retention actions

Policy components:
- **Retention Period**: Duration data is retained
