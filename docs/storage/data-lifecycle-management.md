# Data Lifecycle Management

## Overview
Data lifecycle management (DLM) is the process of managing data throughout its entire lifecycle from creation to deletion. It encompasses policies, processes, and technologies for managing data at each stage, ensuring optimal value, compliance, and cost management.

## Definition
Data lifecycle management is a comprehensive approach to managing data from initial creation through active use, archival, and eventual deletion. It includes policies for data retention, archival, tiering, and disposal, ensuring data is managed appropriately at each stage of its lifecycle.

## Key Concepts

- **Lifecycle Stages**: Creation, active use, archival, deletion
- **Policy-driven**: Driven by policies and rules
- **Automated Management**: Automating lifecycle transitions
- **Cost Optimization**: Optimizing costs throughout lifecycle
- **Compliance**: Ensuring compliance at each stage
- **Value Optimization**: Maximizing data value
- **End-to-end**: Managing entire data lifecycle

## How It Works

Data lifecycle management:

1. **Lifecycle Definition**: Define lifecycle stages
2. **Policy Creation**: Create policies for each stage
3. **Data Classification**: Classify data for lifecycle management
4. **Stage Transitions**: Automate transitions between stages
5. **Storage Optimization**: Optimize storage at each stage
6. **Compliance Monitoring**: Monitor compliance throughout lifecycle
7. **Deletion**: Secure deletion at end of lifecycle

Lifecycle stages:
- **Creation**: Data creation and initial storage
- **Active Use**: Active data usage and processing
- **Archive**: Moving to archive storage
- **Deletion**: Secure data deletion

## Use Cases

- **Cost Optimization**: Optimizing storage costs
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements
- **Data Governance**: Part of data governance program
- **Storage Management**: Managing storage efficiently
- **Risk Management**: Reducing data-related risks
- **Value Optimization**: Maximizing data value

## Considerations

- **Policy Complexity**: Managing complex lifecycle policies
- **Data Classification**: Accurately classifying data
- **Automation**: Automating lifecycle transitions
- **Compliance**: Ensuring compliance at each stage
- **Cost Tracking**: Tracking costs throughout lifecycle
- **Exception Handling**: Handling policy exceptions

## Best Practices

- **Define Lifecycle Stages**: Clearly define lifecycle stages
- **Create Policies**: Comprehensive lifecycle policies
- **Automate Transitions**: Automate lifecycle transitions
- **Classify Data**: Accurately classify data
- **Monitor Compliance**: Monitor compliance throughout lifecycle
- **Optimize Costs**: Optimize costs at each stage
- **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and update policies
- **Document Process**: Document lifecycle management process
