# Data Archiving

## Overview
Data archiving is the process of moving data that is no longer actively used to long-term storage for retention, compliance, or historical reference. It helps manage storage costs while preserving data that may be needed in the future.

## Definition
Data archiving involves moving infrequently accessed data from primary storage to archive storage systems. Archived data is retained for long periods, typically for compliance, legal, or historical purposes, and can be retrieved when needed, though retrieval may take longer than active storage.

## Key Concepts

- **Long-term Storage**: Storage for extended retention periods
- **Inactive Data**: Data no longer actively used
- **Retention Policies**: Policies governing what to archive and when
- **Compliance**: Archiving for regulatory compliance
- **Retrieval**: Ability to retrieve archived data
- **Cost Reduction**: Reducing primary storage costs
- **Data Preservation**: Preserving data for future use

## How It Works

Data archiving:

1. **Archive Policy**: Define what data to archive and when
2. **Data Identification**: Identify data eligible for archiving
3. **Data Extraction**: Extract data to be archived
4. **Archive Storage**: Move data to archive storage
5. **Metadata Catalog**: Maintain catalog of archived data
6. **Data Removal**: Remove from primary storage (optional)
7. **Retrieval Process**: Process for retrieving archived data

Archive storage characteristics:
- **Low Cost**: Lower cost than primary storage
- **Long Retention**: Designed for long-term retention
- **Slower Access**: Slower retrieval than primary storage
- **Durability**: High durability for long-term preservation

## Use Cases

- **Compliance**: Retaining data for regulatory compliance
- **Legal Requirements**: Legal data retention requirements
- **Historical Reference**: Preserving historical data
- **Cost Reduction**: Reducing primary storage costs
- **Data Lifecycle**: Part of data lifecycle management
- **Backup**: Long-term backup storage

## Considerations

- **Retention Requirements**: Understanding retention requirements
- **Retrieval Time**: Acceptable retrieval times
- **Archive Format**: Choosing appropriate archive format
- **Metadata**: Maintaining metadata for retrieval
- **Access Control**: Access controls for archived data
- **Cost**: Archive storage costs

## Best Practices

- **Define Policies**: Clear archiving policies
- **Maintain Metadata**: Comprehensive metadata for retrieval
- **Test Retrieval**: Test archive retrieval process
- **Document Process**: Document archiving and retrieval processes
- **Monitor Compliance**: Ensure compliance with retention requirements
- **Plan Retrieval**: Plan for archive data retrieval
- **Review Regularly**: Review archive policies regularly
