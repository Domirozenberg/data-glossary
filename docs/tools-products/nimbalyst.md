# Nimbalyst

## Overview
Nimbalyst is a data platform focused on data quality, observability, and lineage. It helps teams understand, monitor, and improve the reliability of their data pipelines by providing visibility into data health, lineage tracking, and quality metrics.

## Definition
Nimbalyst provides tools for data discovery, lineage, quality monitoring, and observability. It enables teams to track data flow across systems, detect anomalies, and maintain data quality standards.

## Key Concepts

- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow from source to destination
- **Data Quality**: Monitor completeness, accuracy, consistency
- **Observability**: Visibility into pipeline health and performance
- **Data Profiling**: Understand data characteristics and distributions
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unexpected changes in data
- **Metadata Management**: Collect and organize metadata

## How It Works

Nimbalyst typically connects to data sources, warehouses, and pipelines to:

1. **Discover**: Catalog metadata and schema
2. **Profile**: Analyze data characteristics
3. **Trace Lineage**: Map data flow across systems
4. **Monitor**: Track quality metrics over time
5. **Alert**: Notify on anomalies or quality issues

## Use Cases

- **Data Quality Monitoring**: Track data quality over time
- **Lineage Tracing**: Understand data flow for impact analysis
- **Data Discovery**: Find and understand data assets
- **Compliance**: Support data governance and audit requirements
- **Incident Response**: Debug data issues with lineage

## Considerations

- **Integration**: Depends on connectors for your stack
- **Coverage**: Coverage varies by data source
- **Adoption**: Requires team buy-in for metadata

## Best Practices

- **Integrate Early**: Connect pipelines and warehouses early
- **Define Rules**: Clearly define quality rules and thresholds
- **Use Lineage**: Leverage lineage for impact analysis
